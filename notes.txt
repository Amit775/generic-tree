Notes:
In the abstract tree we have to use template and not content projection
Content projection doesn'tsupport to be projected into ngFor and similars

hence we have to provide a way to manipulate the template of the the tree node, expander, and any of the indicator


to check: in the concrete tree we should implement the template with content prjection
